## 📌 About This Project

OTENIUM is my personal resume and portfolio website, built to showcase who I am, what I can build, and how I approach frontend development.  
It’s a long-term project that will evolve as I learn more about programming, design systems, and modern web technologies.  

The purpose of this website is to create a clean, professional, and minimal digital identity — something that communicates my skills, my personality, and my style as a developer.<br>
OTENIUM is also a playground where I experiment with: 
- UI/UX ideas
- animations
- logos
- and ways to present myself online.
